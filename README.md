# 🌀 Maze 3D Game using Raycasting

## 🧩 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Maze Project** — a 3D game built using **raycasting**!  
This project challenges you to step into the world of classic rendering techniques to simulate a 3D environment from a 2D map, much like the early days of *Doom* or *Wolfenstein 3D*.

You'll learn how to implement a simple yet powerful graphics engine using raycasting principles, creating immersive gameplay inside a maze environment.

## 🎯 Goal

The main objective of this project is to:
- Understand and apply **raycasting techniques** to simulate 3D perspective
- Develop a playable **3D maze game**
- Gain hands-on experience with low-level rendering logic
- Have **fun** while learning graphics programming!

---

## 📚 Background & Instructions

- You **must** begin with the first task, as it sets up the foundation for the rest of the project.
- Other tasks can be done in any order **unless explicitly dependent** on previous ones.
- A detailed raycasting tutorial is provided in the **Tips and Links** section (check your resources).  
  **Take your time to go through it thoroughly** — it’s long but incredibly helpful.
- This project emphasizes **learning through practice**. Tinker, test, break things, and learn!
